<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are already a lot of red team infrastructure as code but none for a simple and fast internal use. So I want to build a simple and useful red team infra hosted on VirtualBox and then on vmware for a more professional use.

**Why internal use ?**
&nbsp; Most infrastructure as a code are designed to be hosted on Amazon AWS or DigitalOcean but I don\'t want to pay an external host just for internal use.

**Why Virtualbox ?**
&nbsp; This infrastructure is designed for Virtualbox so that it can also be used by students who are tired of rebuilding their infra at every project.

**Why Terraform ?**
&nbsp; Terraform is simple to use and allows a destruction of the whole infrastructure in just one command line. Moreover it allows the integration of ansible playbooks easily.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
**What you need before launching on your host :**
* [Virtualbox >= **6.1**](https://www.virtualbox.org)

* [Terraform >= **1.2.5**](https://www.terraform.io)

* [Ansible >= **2.9**](https://ansible.com)


## Installation
1. Launch Virtualbox.

2. Clone the repo :
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/N1neKitsune/PhoenixInfra/
   cd PhoenixInfra/
   ```
3. Change the variables files `variables.tfvars` with your own parameters.

4. Build and launch Infra with Terraform in the `PhoenixInfra` directory:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
5. Wait for terraform to do it all while drinking a üç∫.

6. When finished, close the terminal, go back to Virtualbox and enjoy your infrastructure.
