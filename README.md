<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are already a lot of red team infrastructure as code but none for a simple and fast internal use. So I want to build a simple and useful red team infra hosted on VirtualBox and then on vmware for a more professional use.

**Why internal use ?**

&nbsp; Most infrastructure as a code are designed to be hosted on Amazon AWS or DigitalOcean but I don\'t want to pay an external host just for internal use.

**Why Virtualbox ?**

&nbsp; This infrastructure is designed for Virtualbox so that it can also be used by students who are tired of rebuilding their infra at every project.

**Why Terraform ?**

&nbsp; Terraform is simple to use and allows a destruction of the whole infrastructure in just one command line. Moreover it allows the integration of ansible playbooks easily.
